# Traffic Accident Analysis üìä

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents across various regions and time periods. The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about accident types, causes, weather conditions, lighting, and more. The goal of this project is to identify patterns, trends, and factors that contribute to traffic accidents to help improve road safety and inform policy-making.

## Dataset Information üìÖ
The dataset includes data on traffic accidents and provides various metrics such as accident dates, weather conditions, lighting conditions, crash types, injuries, and vehicle involvement. It spans multiple locations and accident types, offering a broad view of traffic incidents and their causes.

- **trafficway_type:** Type of roadway involved
- **alignment:** Alignment of the road where the accident occurred
- **roadway_surface_cond:** Condition of the roadway surface
- **road_defect:** Road defects present
- **crash_type:** Overall type of the crash
- **intersection_related_i:** Whether the accident was intersection-related
- **damage:** Extent of the damage caused
- **prim_contributory_cause:** Primary cause contributing to the crash
- **num_units:** Number of vehicles involved
- **most_severe_injury:** Most severe injury sustained
- **injuries_total:** Total number of injuries reported
- **injuries_fatal:** Number of fatal injuries
- **injuries_incapacitating:** Number of incapacitating injuries
- **injuries_non_incapacitating:** Non-incapacitating injuries
- **injuries_reported_not_evident:** Injuries reported but not evident
- **injuries_no_indication:** Cases with no indication of injury
- **crash_hour:** Hour the accident occurred
- **crash_day_of_week:** Day of the week the accident occurred
- **crash_month:** Month the accident occurred

Analysis Overview üìà
Trends Over Time:
We analyze accident trends over various time periods, including daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly data. This helps us identify patterns, such as peak accident times, seasonal variations, and yearly trends.

Weather and Lighting Conditions:
We analyze how weather and lighting conditions contribute to accidents. Visualizations and statistics reveal how these factors influence accident frequency and severity.

Crash Type and Contributing Factors:
A deep dive into different crash types and the primary contributory causes of accidents. We identify the most common crash types and the causes that lead to these crashes.

Injuries Analysis:
A comprehensive look at the injuries sustained in accidents. This includes total injuries, fatal injuries, incapacitating injuries, and injuries reported but not visible.

Vehicle Involvement:
We explore the number of vehicles involved in accidents, understanding how multi-vehicle accidents differ from single-vehicle accidents.

Insights and Findings üß†
The analysis reveals key insights such as:

The days of the week and hours that see the highest accident rates.
How weather conditions like rain and fog increase accident likelihood.
The presence of road defects contributing to crashes.
These insights can inform traffic safety measures, policy decisions, and preventive actions for road authorities and urban planners.

Future Work üöÄ
Predictive Modeling: Developing machine learning models to predict accident hotspots based on weather, traffic conditions, and road factors.
Interactive Dashboard: Creating an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore accident data across different regions and time periods.
Geospatial Analysis: Integrating geographical data to visualize accident locations on a map and identify accident-prone areas.
